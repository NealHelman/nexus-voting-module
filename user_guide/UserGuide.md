![Voting Issue Details Page - Cast Your Vote](./screenshots/Issue-Details-Bottom.jpg)

1.  Click the voting option button to place your vote
2.  You'll be prompted to enter your PIN
3.  Your vote sends 0.000001 NXS from your "default" account to the associated option account on-chain
4.  The transaction's reference field includes your weighted vote amount based on your trust and stake
5.  An indicator reveals which voting option you voted on
6.  If an issue does not allow changing your vote, the option buttons will be disabled once you've voted
7.  If an issue does allow changing your vote, only the last vote for your signature chain will be counted
7.  A subsequent version of the backend processing will return your voting NXS once the deadline for the voting has been reached

> üí° Your vote is recorded as a Nexus CREDIT transaction from your sigchain, with your weight calculated as *(trust + stake/1,000,000)*

### üîí Finality Options

- *****one_time*****: You can vote only once
- *****changeable*****: You may change your vote once --- only the **most recent valid vote** from your sigchain is counted

## üßæ Submitting Voting Issues *(Admin Only)*

If your trust level meets the configured threshold, you'll be able to access an **Admin** screen where you can:

- Enter metadata: title, description, pro/con summaries, outcomes,
  deadline, etc.

  - Minimum trust score required to vote defaults to 10000
  - Deadline defaults to 30 days in the future

- Upload supporting documents (text, Markdown, PDF, or Word) to the voting authority server

- Submit the voting issue with a PIN prompt --- this sends NXS to the backend Voting Authority to fund asset and account creation

- Documents can be deleted before submission if desired

> ‚õΩ Cost: 2 NXS for the vote asset + 1 NXS per named voting option account

## üìä Vote Counting and Security

- Vote counts are weighted sums based on each voter's trust and stake
- Tallying reads the *contracts.reference* from each debit transaction to retrieve vote weights
- Only the most recent valid vote per sigchain is included in the total
- Votes are pseudonymous: they are public on-chain but tied to a sigchain hash, not your name

> üîê The module does not store or expose personal data

## üì¢ Announcements and Subscriptions

You can subscribe to be notified of new voting issues via:

- **Email:** A prompt in the Voting tab allows you to subscribe/unsubscribe using your email address and PIN. Emails are sent from *announcement@nexus-voting.com*.
- **Telegram:** New voting issues are optionally announced in a Nexus Community -General Telegram channel.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can I see who voted for what?**\
A: No. Voter identities are not shown, only aggregate weighted vote counts.

**Q: Can I change my vote?**\
A: Only if the vote's finality setting is *changeable*

**Q: Where are my votes stored?**\
A: On-chain in the Nexus ledger --- each vote is a 0.000001 NXS CREDIT to the option account

**Q: Are vote weights public?**\
A: Yes. They are derived from public trust and stake metrics stored in your trust account.  In addition, your weight score at the time you cast a vote is recorded in the Reference field on the vote DEBIT transaction.
